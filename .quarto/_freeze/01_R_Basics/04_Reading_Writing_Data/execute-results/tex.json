We need to get this data *into* R and save our results *out* of R.\n\n## Common Data File Formats\n\n-   **CSV (Comma Separated Values - `.csv`):** Plain text file where columns are separated by commas. Very common, easily readable by many programs (including R and Excel). **Often the best format for sharing data.**\n-   **TSV (Tab Separated Values - `.tsv`):** Similar to CSV, but uses tabs to separate columns.\n-   **Excel Files (`.xls`, `.xlsx`):** Native Microsoft Excel format. Can contain multiple sheets, formatting, formulas. Requires specific R packages to read/write.\n-   **Text Files(`.txt`):** Additionally, data can be saved as a simple text file. This file type can support comma or tab separated values. You would simply need to specify your separator when reading the file.\n\n## Paths, Working Directory, and RStudio Projects (Best Practice!)\n\nR needs to know *where* to find your files.\n\n-   **Working Directory:** The default folder location R looks in. You can see it with `getwd()` and set it with `setwd(\"path/to/folder\")`, but **setting it manually is usually bad practice** because it makes your code non-portable.\n-   **Absolute Path:** The full path from the root of your computer (e.g., `\"C:/Users/YourName/Documents/BreedingData/trial1.csv\"`). **Avoid this!** It breaks if you move folders or share your code.\n-   **Relative Path & RStudio Projects (RECOMMENDED):**\n    1.  Organize your work using an **RStudio Project**. Create one via `File -> New Project -> Existing Directory...` and select your main course folder (`course_project_baku`).\n    2.  When you open the `.Rproj` file, RStudio automatically sets the working directory to that project folder.\n    3.  Keep your data files *inside* the project folder, ideally in subdirectories like `data/raw` (original data) or `data/example` (cleaned data for examples).\n    4.  Refer to files using **relative paths** starting from the project root, like `\"data/example/phenotypes.csv\"`. This makes your analysis reproducible and easy to share!\n\n## Reading Data into R\n\nWe'll use functions from the `readr` (for CSV/TSV) and `readxl` (for Excel) packages. Make sure they are installed (see Module 1.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the necessary libraries\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr) # for glimpse\n\n# --- Reading a CSV file ---\n# Assumes you have a file 'sample_phenotypes.csv' in the 'data/example' folder\n# relative to your project root.\npheno_file_path <- \"data/sample_phenotypes.csv\"\n\n# Check if file exists before trying to read (good habit)\nif (file.exists(pheno_file_path)) {\n  # Use read_csv from the readr package (generally preferred)\n  phenotype_data <- read_csv(pheno_file_path)\n\n  print(\"CSV data loaded successfully:\")\n  head(phenotype_data)   # Look at the first 6 rows\n  glimpse(phenotype_data) # See column names and data types\n\n} else {\n  print(paste(\"Error: Phenotype file not found at\", pheno_file_path))\n  phenotype_data <- NULL # Set to NULL if file not found\n}\n\n# Note: Base R has read.csv() - it works but readr::read_csv() is often faster\n# and handles data types more consistently (e.g., doesn't default strings to factors).\n\n# --- Reading an Excel file ---\n# Assumes you have 'sample_trial.xlsx' in 'data/example'\nexcel_file_path <- \"data/sample_trial.xlsx\" # You'll need to create this file\n\nif (file.exists(excel_file_path)) {\n  # See what sheets are in the workbook\n  excel_sheets(excel_file_path)\n\n  # Read data from a specific sheet (e.g., \"YieldData\")\n  # yield_data_excel <- read_excel(excel_file_path, sheet = \"YieldData\")\n\n  # Or read by sheet number (first sheet is 1)\n  # yield_data_excel <- read_excel(excel_file_path, sheet = 1)\n\n  # print(\"Excel data loaded:\")\n  # glimpse(yield_data_excel)\n\n} else {\n  print(paste(\"Warning: Example Excel file not found at\", excel_file_path))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-   **Always inspect your data after loading!** Use `head()`, `str()`, `glimpse()`, `summary()`. Did R read the column names correctly? Are the data types what you expected (numeric, character, etc.)?\n\n## Writing Data out of R\n\nAfter cleaning data or performing analysis, you'll want to save results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load the necessary libraries\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr) # for glimpse\n\n# --- Reading a CSV file ---\n# Assumes you have a file 'sample_phenotypes.csv' in the 'data/example' folder\n# relative to your project root.\npheno_file_path <- \"data/sample_phenotypes.csv\"\n\n# Check if file exists before trying to read (good habit)\nif (file.exists(pheno_file_path)) {\n  # Use read_csv from the readr package (generally preferred)\n  phenotype_data <- read_csv(pheno_file_path)\n\n  print(\"CSV data loaded successfully:\")\n  head(phenotype_data)   # Look at the first 6 rows\n  glimpse(phenotype_data) # See column names and data types\n\n} else {\n  print(paste(\"Error: Phenotype file not found at\", pheno_file_path))\n  phenotype_data <- NULL # Set to NULL if file not found\n}\n\n# Note: Base R has read.csv() - it works but readr::read_csv() is often faster\n# and handles data types more consistently (e.g., doesn't default strings to factors).\n\n# --- Reading an Excel file ---\n# Assumes you have 'sample_trial.xlsx' in 'data/example'\nexcel_file_path <- \"data/sample_trial.xlsx\" # You'll need to create this file\n\nif (file.exists(excel_file_path)) {\n  # See what sheets are in the workbook\n  excel_sheets(excel_file_path)\n\n  # Read data from a specific sheet (e.g., \"YieldData\")\n  # yield_data_excel <- read_excel(excel_file_path, sheet = \"YieldData\")\n\n  # Or read by sheet number (first sheet is 1)\n  # yield_data_excel <- read_excel(excel_file_path, sheet = 1)\n\n  # print(\"Excel data loaded:\")\n  # glimpse(yield_data_excel)\n\n} else {\n  print(paste(\"Warning: Example Excel file not found at\", excel_file_path))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Exercise:** If you have a simple Excel file with some breeding data (e.g., Plot ID, Variety, Yield), try reading it into R using `read_excel()`. Inspect the loaded data frame using `glimpse()`.\n",
