Widely used in academia and industry for data analysis, including genomics and breeding.\n-   **RStudio:** An excellent, free Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It makes using R much easier with features like code highlighting, plot viewing, package management, and project organization.\n\n## Installation Steps\n\n1.  **Install R:** Go to [CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)](https://cran.r-project.org/) and download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). Follow the installation instructions.\n2.  **Install RStudio:** Go to the [Posit website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and download the free RStudio Desktop version for your operating system. Install it after installing R.\n3.  **Install Quarto:** Go to [Quarto's website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) and download and install Quarto for your system. RStudio often bundles Quarto, but installing the latest version is good practice.\n4.  **(For PDF Output) Install LaTeX:** Open RStudio, go to the Console panel, and type the following commands one by one, pressing Enter after each:\n\n```         \n# Run these lines in the R Console \ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\") \n# Run only once if you don't have it \n# tinytex::install_tinytex() \nRun only once to install LaTeX distribution\n# This might take a few minutes. If it fails, consult TinyTeX documentation or ask instructors.\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Installing R Packages for the Course\n# We will use several add-on packages in R. You only need to install packages *once*.
